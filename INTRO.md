# Getting Started (An Introduction to Coding):
If you are totally new to programming, START HERE.

`NOTE: when learning to code, ALWAYS engage your curiosity. If you want to know why/how something works, ask ChatGPT, Youtube, or Google! (in roughly that order).`

I've divided your Intro To Coding into four main parts:  
- 1a. Concept (Intro)
- 2a. Practice (Intro)
- 1b. Concepts (Deep)
- 2b. Practice (Deep)  

I encourage you to jump between resources, depending on what feels good at the moment: 
- If you feel like actually DOING something with code, try **Practice**.
- If you want to learn concepts, focus on conceptual understanding.

Enjoying and practicing coding before class will go a **long way** in helping understand the fundamentals of programming, and help you get the most out of the course. The faster you develop an intuition for coding, the faster you'll fall in love with it as a medium of expression.

### 1a\. Concept (Intro)
Animated videos are the best shallow introduction to any subject. Hence your nostalgia for Magic School Bus.

#### The best videos explaining web development:
- [Web Dev 101 in 13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erEgovG9WBs) (13 min)  
- [Javascript in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE) (2 min)  
- [100+ Javascript Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU) (12 min)  
- [Git in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) (2 min)  
- [CS 101 in 13 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis) (13 min)  

### 2a\. Practice (Intro)
The best introductory resource for practicing code is a tutorial.
The best tutorials are interactive, and that's where Scrimba comes in.

#### Work through these Scrimba courses, in order, as long as they are challenging:
- [Learn HTML + CSS](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss)  
- [Learn Javascript](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)  
- [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)  

Feel free to skip around or speed up if it's too slow.

### 1b\. Concept (Deep)

#### Readings (more detailed):
- [EloquentJS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/): **Introduction through Chapter 7 [recommended]**  
- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): Chapters 1, 2, and 6  
- [FullStack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/): Part [0b](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps)  

### 2b\. Practice (Deep)
Fullstack Open is the best free online bootcamp. Working through this will prepare you immensely for our bootcamp and increase your velocity a ton!
